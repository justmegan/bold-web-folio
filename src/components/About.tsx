              <p>
                I'm a passionate computer science student with a love for creating 
                innovative web applications and extracting meaningful insights from data. 
                My journey in tech started with curiosity about how digital solutions 
                can solve real-world problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a problem solver at heart, I thrive on challenges that require both 
                analytical thinking and creative solutions. I believe in the power of 
                collaboration and continuous learning to build impactful technology that 
                makes a difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new frameworks, 
                analyzing interesting datasets, or contributing to open-source projects 
                that align with my passion for web development and data analytics.
