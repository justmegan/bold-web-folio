            <p>
              I'm a passionate computer science student with a love for creating 
              innovative web applications and extracting meaningful insights from data. 
              My journey in tech started with curiosity about how digital solutions 
              can solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a problem solver at heart, I thrive on challenges that require both 
              analytical thinking and creative solutions. I believe in the power of 
              collaboration and continuous learning to build impactful technology that 
              makes a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new frameworks, 
              analyzing interesting datasets, or contributing to open-source projects 
              that align with my passion for web development and data analytics.
